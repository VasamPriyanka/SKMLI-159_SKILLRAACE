MACHINE_LEARNING_TASKS


PHASE 1:
TASK 1A - 
(i)Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm Using M L Fundamentals  .(program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree algorithm.)
(ii) Back Propagation Algorithm Using M L Fundamentals.(program for implementing the Back propagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate datasets.)
TASK 1B - Naïve Bayesian Classifier for Text Classification
(Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian classifier model to perform this task. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your dataset.)


PHASE 2:
TASK2 - Rapido Bike Ride Request Forecast using ML( to predict ride-request for a particular hour using machine learning.)


PHASE-3:
Health disorder Predictor Using Machine Learning(aims to implement a robust machine-learning model that can efficiently predict the disease of a human, based on the symptoms that he/she possesses.)
