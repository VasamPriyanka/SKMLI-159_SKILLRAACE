TASK 1A - 
(i)Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm Using M L Fundamentals  .(program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree algorithm.)
(ii) Back Propagation Algorithm Using M L Fundamentals.(program for implementing the Back propagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate datasets.)

TASK 1B - Naïve Bayesian Classifier for Text Classification
(Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian classifier model to perform this task. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your dataset.)
